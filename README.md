# IBM Data Analyst Capstone Project

Welcome to the repository for my IBM Data Analyst Capstone Project. This project is an analysis based on the 'Stack Overflow Developer Survey 2019' data, focusing on trends in programming languages, databases, web frameworks, and platforms preferred by developers.

## Project Overview

This project aims to provide insights into the current and future trends of coding technologies. It also analyzes how demographics such as gender, age, location, and education level affect these trends. The findings are presented using informative and colorful dashboards.

## Data Sources

- **Stack Overflow Developer Survey 2019**: [Survey Results](https://stackoverflow.blog/2019/04/09/the-2019-stack-overflow-developer-survey-results-are-in/)
- **Datasets**:
  - [Demographics Data](https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBM-DA0321EN-SkillsNetwork/LargeData/m5_survey_data_demographics.csv)
  - [Technologies Data](https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBM-DA0321EN-SkillsNetwork/LargeData/m5_survey_data_technologies_normalised.csv)
- **Job Postings**: [GitHub Jobs API](https://jobs.github.com/api)

## Analysis Steps

### 1. Data Collection and Preprocessing
- **Sources**: Job portals, surveys
- **Tools**: Python, SQL, Web Scraping

### 2. Data Wrangling and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- **Tools**: Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn)

### 3. Data Visualization and Dashboard
- **Tools**: IBM Cognos Analytics, IBM Watson Studio

## Results

### Programming Language Trends
- **Findings**:
  - JavaScript and HTML/CSS remain the most popular.
  - Python and TypeScript are gaining interest.
  - Decreased interest in SQL and Bash/Shell/PowerShell.
- **Implications**:
  - Continue employing people skilled in JavaScript and HTML/CSS.
  - Increase hiring for Python and TypeScript.
  - Decrease hiring for SQL and Bash/Shell/PowerShell.

### Database Trends
- **Findings**:
  - Decreased interest in MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server, and SQLite.
  - Increased interest in PostgreSQL and MongoDB.
  - Growing interest in Redis.
- **Implications**:
  - Reduce hiring for MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server, and SQLite.
  - Increase hiring for PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and Redis.

### Web Framework and Platform Trends
- **Findings**:
  - Growing interest in Vue.js and React.js.
  - Decreased interest in Slack and Windows.
- **Implications**:
  - Increase hiring for Vue.js and React.js.
  - Reduce staffing for Slack and Windows.
  - Continue employing enough staff for Linux and increase hiring for Docker, AWS, and Android.

## Overall Findings & Implications

- **Programming Languages**: TypeScript and Python are gaining significant interest, with JavaScript and HTML/CSS remaining crucial.
- **Databases**: Redis, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB are becoming more popular.
- **Platforms**: Interest in Slack and Windows is decreasing.
- **Web Frameworks**: Vue.js is gaining substantial interest, and React.js continues to grow.

## Conclusion

Investing in skills for Python, TypeScript, and JavaScript is recommended for the upcoming years. Firms should allocate budgets to hire additional staff or upskill current employees to meet these demands. Adjust staffing for skills no longer in high demand accordingly.
